The company is holding a competition to encourage the development of innovative bots for its Messenger platform. Called the Bots for Messenger Developer Challenge it’s been announced as a contest which will recognise and reward developers who are able to create the most innovative new bots on Messenger. Messenger, which started off as an instant messaging (IM) service linked to Facebook accounts was spun off as a separate service and has evolved into a platform supporting a host of services that include discount hunting, news delivery, price comparisons, food orders and airline booking.
